First: Create a file called 'Read_File.txt' [minus quotes]
and place it in the same folder as the .exe

Second: Create a file called 'Write_File.txt' [minus quotes]
and place it in the same folder as the .exe 

General Use:
You can use either the Phone_Number.py
or Phone_Number.exe to search through a block of text for phone numbers. 

You can check the Phone_Number.py file notes for specifics
of how it works, and the code, but I will go over general use here.

First, you want the all the files in the same folder:
Phone_Number.exe/Phone_Number.py
Read_File.txt
Write_File.txt
README.txt [optional]

Next, copy/paste the block of text you want to search through 
into the Read_File.txt document. Alternatively, you could 
simply save a text doc as Read_File.txt and remove the original.

The maximum size Read_File.txt doc that will be read by the program
is 500MB. This should be about 300,000 pages or so I believe.

Next, run the .exe or .py (your choice).
The program should tell you which phone number(s) (if any)
were in Read_File.txt before closing with 'Enter.'

Lastly, you can check the Write_File.txt for a saved version of the
list, which would also be labeled with the label you gave it.
The program appends new number lists, so it will not erase previous
information from the Write_File.txt, unless you delete it and save over
it manually. 

Thank you, and as I said further info can be found in the Phone_Number.py.
Enjoy!
